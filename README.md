# Prosthetic Hand

#### Challenges
(1) No alchohol nor cotton sticks to clean my skin for accurate electromyography readings
(2) The muscle sensors bought from Amazon sometimes give off abnormal spikes in the voltage outputs

#### Solutions
(1) Used tape to remove oil, dust, and other dirty particles from my forearm before testing
(2) Read the voltage outputs in intervals and if consecutive intervals produce consistent results, curl the prosthetic fingers
